# VISUAL Project - Investment Platform for Visual Content

## Overview
VISUAL is a web application for investing in visual content projects (2–20 € per category) and influencing project rankings via a voting system. It supports traditional project investments, live shows/battles, and offers a comprehensive portfolio management dashboard. The platform aims to democratize investment in creative content, providing a transparent and engaging experience for small-scale investments with significant market potential in the creator economy.

## User Preferences
- Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
- **IMPORTANT REMINDER**: Rappeler à l'utilisateur de fournir les identifiants Stripe (STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET) avant ou au déploiement de l'application.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform uses a Neon Design System with a dark theme, signature colors (#00D1FF, #7B2CFF, #FF3CAC), Radix UI primitives, shadcn/ui styling, and Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive, and accessible user interface supporting dark mode.

### Technical Implementations

- **Authentication**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect, session-based authentication using `connect-pg-simple`, role-based access (Admin/Investor/Creator), KYC verification, and "Remember me" option for session persistence (browser session vs 7-day session). Login page at `/login` with full i18n support (FR/EN/ES) provides security warnings for trusted vs public devices.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless connection pooling, Drizzle ORM, and Drizzle Kit for migrations.
- **Frontend**: React with Wouter (routing), Zustand (state management), TanStack Query (data fetching), Radix UI with Tailwind CSS.

Features: monthly snapshots in `project_monthly_rankings` table storing rank, investments, ROI, badges (Gold/Silver/Bronze/Rising Star), growth metrics, and daily data for charts; 5 API endpoints (monthly rankings, project history, available months, all-time top performers, project comparison); Leaderboard page (`/leaderboard`) with 3 view modes (Monthly, All-Time, Replay), Recharts visualizations (Area charts for ranking evolution, Bar charts for performance metrics), social media sharing, and CSV export functionality; highlighted "🏆 Classement" navigation link with trilingual support (FR/EN/ES).

### System Design Choices
- **Modularity**: Co-located components and organized imports for maintainability.
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript configuration.
- **Performance**: Client-side filtering and optimized sorting algorithms.
- **Scalability**: Serverless PostgreSQL and clear separation of concerns.
- **Security**: Secure authentication, authorization, content delivery (JWT for ebooks, no exposure of storage keys).
- **AI Agents**: Strategic Autonomous Intelligence (VisualAI, VisualFinanceAI, VisualScoutAI) for automated platform management, content moderation, financial rules, economy management, and ethical audience prospecting, with dedicated database tables for agent decisions and audit logs.
  - **VisualScoutAI**: Ethical prospection agent for detecting, scoring, and activating relevant audiences through official APIs only (Meta, TikTok, YouTube, X), strict GDPR/CCPA compliance, no unsolicited messages, opt-in only contacts, aggregated signals, interest scoring, campaign simulation, and emergency kill-switch.
  - **VisualAI Fraud Detection**: Advanced ML-based fraud detection system with autonomous learning capabilities, behavior analysis, and multi-account detection—always obedient to ADMIN. Features: real-time risk scoring (0-1 scale), bot activity detection, coordinated investment analysis, pattern recognition, and adaptive learning from admin feedback. Risk levels: low (<0.3), medium (0.3-0.6), high (0.6-0.8), critical (>0.8). All high-risk actions (>0.6) require admin validation with traceable audit signatures.

## VisualAI Fraud Detection System (October 2, 2025)

### Architecture Overview
The fraud detection system is integrated into VisualAI service (`server/services/visualAI.ts`) with dedicated database tables for fraud events, risk scores, behavior patterns, and ML metadata.

### Core Components

**1. Risk Scoring Engine**
- Real-time user risk analysis based on behavioral patterns
- 4-tier risk levels: low (<0.3), medium (0.3-0.6), high (0.6-0.8), critical (>0.8)
- Multi-factor analysis: rapid investments, uniform amounts, timing anomalies, volume patterns
- Automatic agent decision creation for risks >0.6

**2. Detection Algorithms**
- **Bot Activity Detection**: Analyzes temporal regularity, action speed, and diversity patterns
- **Coordinated Investment Detection**: Identifies suspicious timing clusters and amount patterns
- **Multi-Account Detection**: Database schema ready for IP/device fingerprinting analysis
- **Rapid Succession Detection**: Flags 5+ investments within configurable time windows (5/15/30/60 min)

**3. Machine Learning Components**
- **Adaptive Learning**: `learnFromAdminFeedback()` adjusts detection thresholds based on admin verdicts
- **Pattern Recognition**: Stores behavior patterns with accuracy metrics (true/false positive tracking)
- **Feature Engineering**: Database tables for `behavior_patterns`, `ml_models`, `learning_session`
- **Continuous Improvement**: Admin feedback loop enables model refinement over time

### Database Schema

**fraud_events**: Event log with evidence data, confidence scores, recommended actions
**user_risk_scores**: Per-user risk profiles with contributing factors
**behavior_patterns**: Reusable patterns with accuracy tracking for ML
**user_relationships**: Multi-account detection via relationship graphs
**ml_models**: Model metadata for version tracking and performance metrics
**learning_session**: Training sessions with feedback incorporation

### API Methods

\`\`\`typescript
// VisualAI service methods
await visualAI.analyzeUserFraudRisk(userId)
await visualAI.detectCoordinatedInvestments(projectId)
await visualAI.learnFromAdminFeedback(decisionId, 'approved' | 'rejected', comment)
\`\`\`

### Admin Control & Audit Trail
- **✅ CRITICAL FIX**: All high-risk detections (>= 0.6) now **strictly** create `'pending'` agent decisions requiring admin review (governance bug fixed Oct 2)
- Complete audit log via `agent_audit_log` table with immutable hash chain
- Admin can approve/reject decisions, triggering ML learning adjustments  
- Fraud events logged to console for v1 (full DB persistence coming in v2 via storage.upsertUserRiskScore/createFraudEvent)

### Security Principles
- **Admin Authority**: All critical actions require admin validation
- **Traceable Decisions**: Every fraud detection logged with justification and evidence
- **Obedient AI**: VisualAI always defers to admin judgment, learns from corrections
- **Zero False Blocks**: Automatic actions limited to low-risk monitoring; humans validate high-risk

### Future Enhancements (v2 Roadmap)
1. **Storage Layer**: Implement `storage.upsertUserRiskScore()` and `storage.createFraudEvent()` for full DB persistence
2. **Regression Tests**: Add test coverage to ensure >= 0.6 → 'pending' rule is maintained
3. **ML Training Pipeline**: Implement scheduled retraining based on admin feedback patterns
4. **Multi-Account Detection**: Complete IP/device fingerprinting integration for relationship detection

## Security Implementations (October 1, 2025)

### Completed Security Enhancements

✅ **Secret Validation** (`server/config/secretsValidator.ts`)
- Validates critical secrets at startup
- **Blocks production** if default/insecure secrets detected
- Active: See startup logs for validation status

✅ **CORS Configuration** (`server/config/corsConfig.ts`)
- Production: Strict domain whitelist
- Development: Allows all origins for Vite HMR
- Active: Applied to all requests

✅ **Structured Logger** (`server/config/logger.ts`)
- Environment-aware log levels (DEBUG→INFO in prod)
- Automatic masking of sensitive data
- Implementation complete - Progressive migration needed
- Guide: `server/config/LOGGING_GUIDE.md`

✅ **NPM Vulnerabilities**: Fixed 3 low-severity issues
- Remaining 6 moderate: Development-only (esbuild)
- No production runtime vulnerabilities

### Pre-Production Checklist

**CRITICAL:**
- [ ] Generate & configure production secrets (AUDIT_HMAC_KEY, VISUAL_PLAY_TOKEN_SECRET, ADMIN_CONSOLE_SECRET)
- [ ] Verify Stripe keys use `sk_live_` prefix
- [ ] Configure CORS production domains

**HIGH PRIORITY:**
- [ ] Migrate critical services to structured logger (see LOGGING_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] Test production configuration with NODE_ENV=production

**BEFORE DEPLOYMENT:**
\`\`\`bash
# Generate secrets
openssl rand -base64 32

# Set in Replit Secrets:
AUDIT_HMAC_KEY=<generated>
VISUAL_PLAY_TOKEN_SECRET=<generated>
ADMIN_CONSOLE_SECRET=<generated>
\`\`\`
