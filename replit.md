## VisualAI Fraud Detection System (October 2, 2025)

### Architecture Overview
The fraud detection system is integrated into VisualAI service (`server/services/visualAI.ts`) with dedicated database tables for fraud events, risk scores, behavior patterns, and ML metadata.

### Core Components

**1. Risk Scoring Engine**
- Real-time user risk analysis based on behavioral patterns
- 4-tier risk levels: low (<0.3), medium (0.3-0.6), high (0.6-0.8), critical (>0.8)
- Multi-factor analysis: rapid investments, uniform amounts, timing anomalies, volume patterns
- Automatic agent decision creation for risks >0.6

**2. Detection Algorithms**
- **Bot Activity Detection**: Analyzes temporal regularity, action speed, and diversity patterns
- **Coordinated Investment Detection**: Identifies suspicious timing clusters and amount patterns
- **Multi-Account Detection**: Database schema ready for IP/device fingerprinting analysis
- **Rapid Succession Detection**: Flags 5+ investments within configurable time windows (5/15/30/60 min)

**3. Machine Learning Components**
- **Adaptive Learning**: `learnFromAdminFeedback()` adjusts detection thresholds based on admin verdicts
- **Pattern Recognition**: Stores behavior patterns with accuracy metrics (true/false positive tracking)
- **Feature Engineering**: Database tables for `behavior_patterns`, `ml_models`, `learning_session`
- **Continuous Improvement**: Admin feedback loop enables model refinement over time

### Database Schema

**fraud_events**: Event log with evidence data, confidence scores, recommended actions
**user_risk_scores**: Per-user risk profiles with contributing factors
**behavior_patterns**: Reusable patterns with accuracy tracking for ML
**user_relationships**: Multi-account detection via relationship graphs
**ml_models**: Model metadata for version tracking and performance metrics
**learning_session**: Training sessions with feedback incorporation

### API Methods

\`\`\`typescript
// VisualAI service methods
await visualAI.analyzeUserFraudRisk(userId)
await visualAI.detectCoordinatedInvestments(projectId)
await visualAI.learnFromAdminFeedback(decisionId, 'approved' | 'rejected', comment)
\`\`\`

### Admin Control & Audit Trail
- **‚úÖ CRITICAL FIX**: All high-risk detections (>= 0.6) now **strictly** create `'pending'` agent decisions requiring admin review (governance bug fixed Oct 2)
- Complete audit log via `agent_audit_log` table with immutable hash chain
- Admin can approve/reject decisions, triggering ML learning adjustments  
- Fraud events logged to console for v1 (full DB persistence coming in v2 via storage.upsertUserRiskScore/createFraudEvent)

### Security Principles
- **Admin Authority**: All critical actions require admin validation
- **Traceable Decisions**: Every fraud detection logged with justification and evidence
- **Obedient AI**: VisualAI always defers to admin judgment, learns from corrections
- **Zero False Blocks**: Automatic actions limited to low-risk monitoring; humans validate high-risk

### Future Enhancements (v2 Roadmap)
1. **Storage Layer**: Implement `storage.upsertUserRiskScore()` and `storage.createFraudEvent()` for full DB persistence
2. **Regression Tests**: Add test coverage to ensure >= 0.6 ‚Üí 'pending' rule is maintained
3. **ML Training Pipeline**: Implement scheduled retraining based on admin feedback patterns
4. **Multi-Account Detection**: Complete IP/device fingerprinting integration for relationship detection

## Security Implementations (October 1, 2025)

### Completed Security Enhancements

‚úÖ **Secret Validation** (`server/config/secretsValidator.ts`)
- Validates critical secrets at startup
- **Blocks production** if default/insecure secrets detected
- Active: See startup logs for validation status

‚úÖ **CORS Configuration** (`server/config/corsConfig.ts`)
- Production: Strict domain whitelist
- Development: Allows all origins for Vite HMR
- Active: Applied to all requests

‚úÖ **Structured Logger** (`server/config/logger.ts`)
- Environment-aware log levels (DEBUG‚ÜíINFO in prod)
- Automatic masking of sensitive data
- Implementation complete - Progressive migration needed
- Guide: `server/config/LOGGING_GUIDE.md`

‚úÖ **NPM Vulnerabilities**: Fixed 3 low-severity issues
- Remaining 6 moderate: Development-only (esbuild)
- No production runtime vulnerabilities

### Pre-Production Checklist

**CRITICAL:**
- [ ] Generate & configure production secrets (AUDIT_HMAC_KEY, VISUAL_PLAY_TOKEN_SECRET, ADMIN_CONSOLE_SECRET)
- [ ] Verify Stripe keys use `sk_live_` prefix
- [ ] Configure CORS production domains

**HIGH PRIORITY:**
- [ ] Migrate critical services to structured logger (see LOGGING_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] Test production configuration with NODE_ENV=production

**BEFORE DEPLOYMENT:**
\`\`\`bash
# Generate secrets
openssl rand -base64 32

# Set in Replit Secrets:
AUDIT_HMAC_KEY=<generated>
VISUAL_PLAY_TOKEN_SECRET=<generated>
ADMIN_CONSOLE_SECRET=<generated>
\`\`\`
